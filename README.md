This program scans the folder for records, sorts them according to the user criteria and writes the result in output file.

Record - a line that is in the txt file. Each line has three fields:
1. User Name (example - Anastasia
2. The date in the format  d-MM-yyyy (for example - 25/02/2016)
3. Message
The delimiter is the character - '|';
Sample lines:
Mama|20-03-2015|How are you
Anastasia|25-02-2016|Hello man

1. Find the record by the name of the user.
2. Find the records by the period of time.
